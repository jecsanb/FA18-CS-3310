 *  Assignment 5
 *
 *  In this assignment you will store user input two square matrices of size n <= 10
 *  as one dimensional arrays and compute the product of the first matrix times
 *  the second matrix and store as another a single dimensional array and display
 *  the product.
 *
 *  You can use only single dimension arrays for input and product matrices.
 *
 *  Your program must use malloc to allocate block of memory to store input
 *  and product matrices as single dimensional arrays
 *
 * You program must compute product of the input matrices using a function such as:
 * void mult(int * a, int *, int *b, int *c, int n), where matrix array c = matrix array
 * a matrix array b, and n is size of the matrix.
